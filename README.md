Computational Practices
Tiny or Huge:
  line 10: (50, 100)
           (100, 100) //range of how small and big the bubbles can be
           (50, 100)
           (2, 100)
           
  line 31: 2
           5 //didn't see much of a difference
           20 //bubble grew in size and compacted
           
           
Change of Initial Number of Bubbles:
  line 6: (var i = 0; i<10;++)
          (        100  ...  )  //bubbles dissapeared
          (        6    ...  )  //turns out that controls the distance between each bubble (maybe width)
          (        ...  30   )  //bubbles increased
          (        ...  60   )  //I guess it changes the quantity of bubbles
          
          
Change of Bubbles' Color:
  line 26: (255, 200, 200, 200)
           (605, ..., ..., ...) //no change
           (..., 600, ..., ...) //fill turned yellow when hovered by mouse
           (..., ..., 600, ...) //now white
           (..., ..., 100, ...) //yellow from before turned more vibrant
           (..., ..., ..., 050) //yellow turned more transparent
           
  line 28: (255, 220, 200, 200)
           (555, ..., ..., ...) //didn't dotice a difference
           (100, ..., ..., ...) //fill turned cyan
           (..., 120, ..., ...) //hue changed to make a more neutral blue
           (..., 920, ..., ...) //changed to a more teal color
           (..., ..., 900, ...) //turned to a light blue
           (..., ..., ..., 050) //opacity lowered
           
           
Bubbles More Vigorous:
  line 32: (-1, 1)
           (-5, ...) //bubble vibrated to the left
           (..., 5)   //bubble vibrating more vigorously, horizontally
           
  line 33: (-1, 1)
           (-5, ...)  //bubbles vibrated north
           (..., 5) //bubbles vibrating more vigorously. vertically
           
           
Interesting changes:
  line 19: (vari = 0; i < bubbles.lengh; i++)
           (       30                       ) //didnt really see a difference
           (       100                      ) //think it changes the distance between the bubbles, vertically
